Summary:

BET class created and implemented to transform postfix expressions into
infix expressions (ex. 5 6 + postfix translates to 5 + 6 infix). Utilizes
tree structures and creates a stack out of the nodes for translation.
Also includes copy, print, size, creation, and deletion functions for
further utility.
